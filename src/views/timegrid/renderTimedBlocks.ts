// an extreme drag (e.g. the pointer released far outside the visible grid) could compute a start

// comes back `undefined`, and the task drops out of every time-based view while the garbage text
// leaks into the visible title. Clamping here keeps every value this module ever *computes*
// inside a single real calendar day, so it can never produce that class of value in the first

// Code review gap (fix): every pointer-drag gesture below (`attachDrag`'s move/resize, and
// `attachHorizontalResize`'s left/right edges) tears down its state — including, for resize,
// restoring `block`'s `draggable="true"` — from a `cleanup()` reachable only via `pointerup`/
// `pointercancel`. If NEITHER is ever delivered for a given gesture (e.g. the pointer is
// released while positioned outside the browser window entirely, or some other browser/OS quirk
// swallows the up-event), cleanup never runs and, for a resize gesture, `draggable` stays
// "false" forever — silently disabling the legitimate whole-block native-drag-to-all-day feature
// until the block's next from-scratch re-render.
//
// Pointer Capture (`setPointerCapture`/`releasePointerCapture`) is the standard, spec-correct fix
// for exactly this class of problem: per the Pointer Events spec, once an element captures a
// pointerId, that element keeps receiving `pointermove`/`pointerup` for that pointer even if it
// moves outside the element — or outside the browser window/document — for the remainder of the
// gesture. That is a guarantee from the browser itself, not something this codebase's own logic
// can fail to uphold, so it closes the gap for real rather than adding another window/document
// listener that could itself be skipped by the same class of quirk.
//
// Verified this does NOT fight the existing native-HTML5-DnD-hijack-produces-pointercancel
// behavior these same handlers already rely on (see attachDrag's onPointerCancel/cleanup and
// attachHorizontalResize's mirror of it): Pointer Capture and HTML5 Drag-and-Drop are two
// independent browser subsystems, but the spec is explicit that starting a native drag operation
// implicitly releases any active pointer capture and then fires `pointercancel` at the (now
// former) capturing element — i.e. capture does not suppress or delay the hijack's pointercancel,
// it just additionally guarantees delivery for the ordinary (non-hijacked) release path this
// gap is about. `releasePointerCapture` in `cleanup()` below is therefore redundant-but-cheap
// hygiene for the two paths that already end in a real pointerup/pointercancel; the guarantee
// that actually closes the gap is the implicit one the browser provides for a captured pointer
// that never gets hijacked into DnD.
//
// jsdom implements neither method at all (confirmed: `typeof el.setPointerCapture === 'undefined'`
// — calling it throws, it does not silently no-op), so both helpers below feature-detect before
// calling, keeping every existing pointerdown-driven test in this file (most of which stub these
// two methods onto the element under test) working unchanged, and tolerating any other host that
// similarly lacks Pointer Events capture support.

/**
 * Task 29: renders the lighter, non-interactive "continuation" segment for a non-anchor day of

 * this project's due-centric anchor-priority rule) gets the full interactive block via
 * `renderTimedBlocksForDay` instead; every OTHER day the span covers gets this instead, so the
 * same task never renders two full interactive blocks across a Week view.
 *
 * Deliberately minimal — no checkbox, no drag, no resize handles, no markdown-link-aware title
 * rendering (a plain textContent title, unlike the anchor block's renderTaskText) — visually
 * similar in spirit to MonthGridView's existing `.tc-mg-span-segment` continuation bars for
 * untimed spans: clearly linked to the task (same title, tag color, time-of-day position) but
 * unmistakably not a second interactive copy of it. A contextmenu still opens the task modal
 * (`onTaskClick`), same as a full block, since that's a read-only action.
 *
 * Task 35 (expanded scope): also shows the same time-range+duration subtitle and count badges
 * (subtasks/comments/links) the anchor block shows, so a continuation segment reads as more than
 * just a title bar — but stays purely presentational: no checkbox, and neither the subtitle nor
 * the badges container gets a click/drag handler, so this remains as non-interactive as before.
 *
 * Task 37: like `.tc-tg-block`, `.tc-tg-block-continuation` has a CSS min-height that keeps a
 * short segment's title legible — but, unlike anchor blocks, continuation segments never go
 * through `packOverlaps`'s column-collision avoidance (they're always rendered full-width, one
 * per task). `capContinuationMinHeightsPx` closes that gap: `otherBlocks` lets a caller pass the
 * SAME day's already-positioned anchor blocks (see `toTimedBlockInputs`) so a continuation's
 * min-height growth is clamped against those too, not just other continuations.

  // pointer session it fires `pointercancel` instead of `pointerup` for that pointer. Without
  // this handler, `mode` and the window pointermove/pointerup listeners from the aborted
  // gesture would never be torn down — leaking listeners that would double-fire on the next
  // real gesture — and no mutation must fire here (the drop is handled by the native DnD
  // dragend/drop path instead, not this pointer session).
  //
  // Investigated as a possible root cause of "drag-to-reschedule lands at the wrong time":
  // `onPointerMove` above already repositions `block.style.top`/`height` live, on every
  // pointermove, as a preview of the not-yet-committed move/resize. A native-drag hijack can
  // fire at any point during an ordinary vertical move gesture too — per the HTML Drag and Drop
  // spec, arming only needs the pointer to move past a small threshold while the button is held
  // on a draggable="true" element, in ANY direction, not specifically toward the all-day row.
  // Without the reset below, a hijacked gesture left the block's DOM position/size sitting at
  // whatever the last live-preview pointermove had set it to, even though NO mutation had
  // committed (onTimeChange/onDurationChange only fire from onPointerUp, never from here) — a
  // real, visible divergence between what the block showed and the task's actual, unchanged
  // data, persisting until some unrelated re-render happened to overwrite it. Reverting to the
  // pre-gesture position/size here, unconditionally, keeps the DOM never ahead of committed data
  // regardless of what (if anything) the hijacked native drag itself goes on to do — including
  // the legitimate case where it lands on the all-day row and converts the task via a completely
  // separate mutation path (renderAllDay.ts's onDrop/rescheduleTask), which is free to run

/**
 * Task 29: right-edge horizontal drag-resize, extending a timed block into a multi-day timed
 * span. Mirrors renderAllDay.ts's `attachEdgeResize` exactly (same Pointer-Events pattern: no
 * live visual feedback while dragging, just a commit-on-release that resolves the day under the
 * pointer) rather than inventing a new interaction style — the day boundary crossing is resolved
 * from the pointer's final (clientX, clientY) via `activeDocument.elementFromPoint`, walking up
 * to the nearest `[data-tg-date]` ancestor (HourGrid.ts's `.tc-tg-day-column`, one per rendered
 * date), NOT by accumulating a per-pixel delta within a single column — so dragging across 2-3
 * day columns resolves to whichever column the pointer is over at release, however far that is.
 *
 * `hourColumnEl` (the per-day column this block was rendered into) doubles as the test seam
 * anchor: real usage never reads from it directly, but jsdom's `elementFromPoint` always returns
 * null, so tests drive the same deterministic `__tgPendingEdgeResizes`/`__tgTestEndDrag` seam
 * renderAllDay.ts established (Round 2 Task 9), registered here per-day-column instead of
 * per-all-day-cell.
 *
 * Task 34: also used for the left edge (moves/adds `start`) — both edges share this same
 * mechanics function, differing only in which mutation callback `onResolve` invokes on
 * resolution, mirroring how renderAllDay.ts's single `attachEdgeResize` already serves its
 * left/right/plain-right handles alike.
