// sides, not read from the DOM — see the comment on `capMinHeightsPx` below for why this can't
// just be measured). The value is derived, not guessed: `.tc-tg-block` sets `padding: 2px 6px`
// (2px top + 2px bottom) and `font-size: 0.8em`; its tallest row is `.tc-tg-block-head`, whose
// checkbox (`.tc-status-marker`) is sized at `1.6em` of that same 0.8em block font-size — so the
// minimum height that keeps the checkbox+title row fully legible is 2*2px of padding plus that
// 1.6em marker height. Obsidian's own base font-size is 16px, so this resolves to a concrete
// pixel figure for the JS-side collision-avoidance pass below; the CSS rule itself uses `calc()`
// with real `em`s, so it stays correct even if the user's actual root font-size differs — this
// constant is only a (deliberately close, not exact) approximation for that JS pass.

/**
 * Task 36: `.tc-tg-block`'s CSS `min-height` (see styles.css) guarantees a short-duration block
 * never renders too short to show its checkbox+title row legibly — but that min-height can only
 * ever GROW a block past the height its actual duration would give it (`minutesToPixels`
 * never shrinks to make room). Two blocks in the same column are only ever placed there by
 * `packOverlaps` because they don't overlap in time (the column-reuse rule requires the previous
 * occupant to have already ended) — but "don't overlap in time" doesn't mean "have enough real
 * estate for both to hit the CSS min-height without visually touching/crossing." A block whose
 * min-height-inflated box would cross into the next same-column block's own top needs its
 * min-height clamped back down to whatever room is actually available.
 *
 * Returns, for each block (keyed by object identity — safe since `packOverlaps` already
 * allocates a fresh object per input), the maximum height in pixels it may occupy before
 * reaching the next block sharing its column (or `Infinity` if it's the last/only occupant of
 * that column, in which case the CSS min-height is free to apply in full).
