   * `shouldScrollToNow` (Task 27): TodayView/WeekTimeGridView use this to decide whether to run
   * their one-time scroll-to-now on this render. It defaults to true so every other caller
   * (tests, BaseView.patch below, views that don't have a now-line at all) keeps prior behavior
   * unchanged; only CenterPanel — which owns the (calViewType, calDate) key that survives its
   * mountView() destroy/recreate cycle — ever passes `false`, and only for a reactive re-render
   * of a view/date it has already scrolled for.
   *
   * `preservedScrollTop` (Task 31): CenterPanel.mountView() destroys and recreates the view
   * instance on every render, including reactive ones, so a freshly-created `.tc-tg-grid-row`
   * naturally starts at `scrollTop = 0`. When `shouldScrollToNow` is false (a reactive
   * re-render, not a fresh navigation), TodayView/WeekTimeGridView restore this value onto the
   * new grid-row instead of leaving it at 0, so a task mutation elsewhere never silently resets
   * the user's scroll position. Ignored/unused when `shouldScrollToNow` is true — a genuine
   * fresh navigation always takes the scroll-to-now path instead of inheriting a stale position.
